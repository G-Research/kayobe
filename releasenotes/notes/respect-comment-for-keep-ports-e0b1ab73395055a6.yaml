    If you have customized ``inspector_keep_ports``, ensure it is set to one of:
    ``all``, ``present``, ``added``.

    ``inspector_keep_ports`` can be set to one of: ``all``, ``present``,
    ``added``. The previous behavior was to set this to ``present`` if the
    variable was changed to any non-None value. This respects the behavior
    indicated in the comments.
